## Overview of the Analysis


The purpose of this analysis is to see if the model could accurately predict loan defaults based on the data.
The data we had was:
* Loan size
* Interest Rate
* Borrower Income
* Debt-to-Income Ratio
* Number of accounts
* Deragatory Remarks
* Total Debt
* Loan Status

We separated the data and then performed a test and train function.  We created a logistical regression model.

Finally, we generated a confusion model. 

I was assisted in this exercise by TA Sheri Rosalia and classmates Carmen Wiggins, Haritha Koleti, and Michelle Petras.
